This directory contains a mockup of modules that are used as dependencies
of this project.

They are used to build the documentation as sphinx fails to import the
dependencies offered by gdb and can't build the docs.  Likewise,
readthedocs.org doesn't provide the dependencies (and shouldn't), so
the mock modules are used to allow the build process to succeed.
