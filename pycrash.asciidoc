DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *pycrash* utility is a Linux kernel crash debugger written in Python.  It
improves upon the original crash tool by adding support for symbolic

In order to operate properly, full debuginfo is required for the kernel
image and all modules in use.

the kernel or modules.

This option may be specified multiple times.

*--gdb*::
Start the gdb instance used with crash-python within gdb.
+
This option is primarily intended for debugging gdb issues.

*--valgrind*::
Start the gdb instance used with crash-python within valgrind.
+
This option is primarily intended for debugging gdb issues.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*pycrash* returns a zero exit status if it succeeds.  Non zero is returned in
case of failure.

AVAILABILITY

*pycrash* is part of crash-python.
